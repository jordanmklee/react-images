# Images

A gallery webapp that retrieves images from a job/timesheet ID via a URL generated by the dashboard. There are 2 views:

- A list view where the user can click on thumbnails on the vertical photo library, and display the full resolution image on the main display. From there, the user can zoom, pan, and rotate the image for more details.

- A grid view where all the images can be viewed at once. Similarly to the other view, clicking on a thumbnail reveals a full screen lightbox where the user can interact with the full resolution image, as well as cycle between the other images.
